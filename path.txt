Now I have come to crossroads in my life, I always knew what the right path was. 
Without exception, I knew, but I never took it, you know why, it was too * hard. 
Now here's Charlie, he's come to the crossroads, he has chosen a path. 
It's the right path, it's a path made of principle that leads to character. 
Let him continue on his journey. 
You hold this boy's future in your hands, committee, it's a valuable future, believe me. 
Don't destroy it, protect it. Embrace it. It's gonna make you proud one day, I promise you. 
How's that for cornball?
